### Putting a 2020 Design course live
To avoid issues with Google linking to older Professional Course pages, we need the URL of new Professional Course pages to match the older course. This can't be actioned until the new page goes live.

Here's what to do:
- When ready to put the new page live, go to the old entry.
- Find the old entry's slug and copy it. Now add `-old` to the end of it. That changes the address the old page sits at. We have to do this because two entries cannot have the same address.
- Disable the old entry and save it.
- Go to the new entry and replace the new entry's slug with the one you copied from the old entry.
- Enable the new entry. Save it.
